# GoSandbox

Just my personal Golang sandbox repo, nothing special.

Each package may contain multiple versions where I experiment with different approaches to the same problem. Each version has its own README with more details.  And yes, this was mainly written by AI.

## Packages

- **fstree** — A toy file system tree (like the `tree` command) implementation to learn about Go's concurrency primitives (goroutines, wait groups, mutexes, channels and all that 🎷).

- **tui** - A Terminal User Interface to run one of the packages and one its versions.
